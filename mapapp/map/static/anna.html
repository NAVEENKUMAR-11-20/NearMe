   <center> <h1>ANNA ARCH<h1>  <center>
        <pre>Anna Arch in Arumbakkam is an iconic structure that stands as a testament 
to Chennai's architectural legacy. Maintenance efforts focus on preserving
its aesthetic appeal and ensuring the area remains tidy and accessible to the 
public. Regular inspections are carried out to address wear and tear, keeping 
the structure in good condition. While there isn’t a formal 
customer service desk, municipal authorities occasionally install information
boards to guide visitors. Traffic management around the arch is also prioritized to ensure 
smooth vehicular movement. Plans for enhanced lighting during the evening hours and periodic
repainting further contribute to its upkeep, making it a 
valued part of Chennai’s urban landscape. </pre>
